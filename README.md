We're working on coming up with a system which can parse student's ambiguous notation and either offer suggestions or decided what is meant based on context.

## Parsing libraries

* [PEGjs](https://pegjs.org/) - creates simple, unambiguous parsers.
* [Nearley](http://nearley.js.org/) - creates very versatile parsers, and returns multiple results for ambiguous grammars.
